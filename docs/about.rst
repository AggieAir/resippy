About ReSIPPy
=============


What is it?
-----------

ReSIPPy is a set of tools to perform image processing with a focus on overhead and spectral remote sensing applications.
Some features include:

* Navigation from world coordinate to camera pixel coordinates
* Navigation from pixel coordinates to world coordinates
* Orthorectification
* Spectral matched filters
* Reading spectral libraries


Why does it exist?
------------------

ReSIPPy exists as a tool to help us (and we hope others) to quickly prototype and build image processing software without having to think too hard about the data-structures that are needed and or common tasks that are done.
